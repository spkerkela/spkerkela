The following story has been generated with an AI, the text that appears `like this` was my input, everything else was written by the AI. I call it "A night out with the boys".

# A night out with the boys

`Henri, Simo and Kristian are three men from the city of Helsinki, out in the year 2020 for a couple of beers at the famous Kallio district. It is 22.00 and the sky is dark.` 

The night has not been kind to them.

"We're going to have a hell of a time getting there," says Simo. "The traffic's bad."

"I know what you mean," says Henri. "And we can't see anything out here."

They continue to talk about their problems as they walk along the road.

`Kristian spots a cool looking bar, it is called "Hellsing bar". Simo has a bad feeling about this.`

"Why the hell is there a Hell's Angel in our territory?" he asks.
"Please just follow me," you reply, as you lead the men into the bar.

`You look at what Is on the tap in this bar`

There are about five people in the bar, a large man with long hair, who is leaning against a wall, a boy who is reading a newspaper, a younger man with tattoos on his arms, holding a cigarette between his lips, and an older man with a handlebar mustache.
You walk towards the man with the mustache.
"Good evening," you say. "And may I say, gentlemen, how are you this evening?"
"I'm great, thanks," says the man with the mustache. "And yourself? What will it be?"
"I'll have what he's having," says Simo.
"Got any cigarettes?" asks Kristian.

`You ask the bartender: "What is the best beer you have?"`

"We've got Hite, Galaxus Premium and Asahi," says the man. "You wanna try 'em?"

`You order Hite, Simo orders Galaxus Premium. Kristian orders some Karhu.`

"So, you from Helsinki?" asks the man with the mustache.
"Correct," you reply. "My friends, the usual."
You all clink glasses and drink.

`You look outside the bar window.`

A bum, covered in wounds and scars, is lying on the street.
"Do you think he's dead?" asks the man. "He really needs help."
You pocket your knife and walk outside.

`You look at the bum more closely, but keep a safe distance.`

You notice a strange tattoo on his arm, depicting a snake swallowing its own tail.
You walk up to the bum and kick him in the face. You search him and take a wallet from his pocket.

`You ask Simo if he recognises the tattoo on the bum's arm.`

"I recognise that tattoo," says Simo. "It's called an S-FISH."

`You ask what is an "s-fish"`

"Severed Friend In a Sleeveless Garb"
You wince, and the bartender sighs.

`You ask Kristian wether you should call the ambulance.`

"It's probably best not to," says the bartender.
You quickly start to regret going into the bar.
"Do you know what this tattoo means?" you ask the bum.
"I have a rudimentary understanding of the English language," says the bum. "It means ' severed friend in a sleeveless garb', friends."

`You look around the street.`

There is a hook by the door, a coat rack, a broken-down pay phone, a trash bin, a tree and the pavement.
You notice a strange bulge in the man's coat. You pull out your knife, and cut open the coat. You find a large revolver. You check the chamber, and put the gun back into the coat.

`You ask Simo to pick up the gun, "just in case"`

"Just in case what?" asks Simo.
"Just in case this man becomes violent," you say, as you hand him the gun.
"Sure," says Simo.

`You ask Kristian what you should do next.`

"We should rob the guy," says Kristian. "I'll go in first, to make sure he doesn't have a hidden blade or something."
You nod.
"I'll just stay here and take the wallet with the gun," says Simo.
As you watch them approach the bum, you consider what options are open to you. You could attempt to escape, and see if you can get a police search team to come to the bar. You could wait until they return with the wallet, then attempt to escape. Finally, you could just watch and hope for the best.

`You decide to not rob the bum and instead leave the bar.`

You walk outside and hail a taxi. You tell the cabbie your address, and sit in the back seat without mentioning your friends. "Perfect", you think to yourself. "They're stupid enough to walk into a trap, and I'll be home free. I'd rather be with the real gang, but this'll have to do."
You notice the bum is walking towards your car. "What the hell, he's trying to get my attention", you think to yourself. "Maybe he's lost."
You get out of the car and approach the bum. "Hi, are you okay?" you say, in an attempt to start a conversation.
The bum pulls out a knife and stabs you in the throat. He then does the same to your stomach, and you collapse on the ground.

`You yell for Simo to shoot the bum.`

"Shoot the bum!" you yell.
"Are you sure?" asks Simo.
You nod vigorously.
"Can I really?" asks a shocked Simo. "I've only shot at targets before."
"You can if you try really hard!" you say.
"Hold on", says Kristian, "shouldn't we ransom him for money or something before we shoot him?"
"No" you say, "we should just shoot him now before he has a chance to blurt out our plans".
"But it's not necessary to kill him!" says Simo. "Just wound him, and we can interrogate him later."
You decide to sort out the bum's willingness to follow your orders later. For now, though, you need to decide what to do.

`You try to escape from the bum.`

You quickly crawl away from the bum, and manage to get back to your feet. As he draws a long dagger from his side, you crawl backwards.

`You ask Simo to shoot the bum before the bum kills you.`

"Shoot him! Shoot him!" you yell.
"I really don't think I can, mate", says Simo. "The gun's no good at all and I don't have any silver bullets."

`You ask Simo to at least try.`

"Alright", says Simo, "I'll try."
He aims the gun at the bum and fires. Unfortunately, he shoots you in the head instead.
